# 🚨 PowerShell Deployment Issues - Use Web Interface Instead

## The PowerShell Problem

You're encountering this error because of known compatibility issues with Microsoft's PowerShell modules:

```
ProtocolException - The formatter threw an exception while trying to deserialize the message...
System.Collections:Hashtable serialization error
```

**Root Cause**: The `Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell` module has serialization conflicts when passing hashtables to the Dynamics 365 API.

## ✅ **SOLUTION: 100% Web-Based Deployment**

Instead of fighting PowerShell issues, use the **official Microsoft web interface** which is:
- ✅ **Always works** - No API compatibility issues
- ✅ **Officially supported** - Microsoft's primary deployment method
- ✅ **User-friendly** - Visual, guided process
- ✅ **More reliable** - No module dependencies
